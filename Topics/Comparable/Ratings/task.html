<p>A website uses the <code class="java">Rating</code> class to store information about ratings of publications. It has two integer fields: <code class="java">upVotes</code> and <code class="java">downVotes</code> , and implements the <code class="java">Comparable</code> interface. Your task is to write its <code class="java">compareTo</code> method. Two <code class="java">Rating</code> objects must be compared by a "net rating" which is calculated as a difference between the number of upvotes and the number of downvotes.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
