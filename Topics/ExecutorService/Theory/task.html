<p>The main purpose of using multithreading is concurrent execution and multi-user support. In the case of multi-core processors, we even have parallel execution of tasks.

The Executor Service can be initialized with a fixed number of threads or a growing pool of threads. Once the tasks are completed, it is important to shut down the Executor Service to free up resources and allow the JVM to terminate."><strong>executor services</strong></a>. Executor services simplify the asynchronous execution of tasks and automatically provide a pool of threads and an interface for assigning tasks to them.
