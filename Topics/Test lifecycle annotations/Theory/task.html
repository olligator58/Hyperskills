<p>You already know how to write simple tests using a variety of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12867" target="_blank" title="In Java, an assertion is a method used to enforce invariants, check method preconditions and postconditions, and ensure that a certain condition is met before or after a method is invoked. | The key limitation when using assertions is that they should never produce side effects and change the way a program operates. This means that the assertion should not affect a program in any way other than throwing an error. Assertions can be written using various libraries such as AssertJ, which provides a fluent API with a wide range of built-in assertion methods. AssertJ also allows you to perform custom assertions or a series of assertions on an object using a lambda expression, a method reference, or an anonymous inner class.">assertion methods</a> and <code class="language-java">@Test</code> annotations. Now we are going to learn about the test class lifecycle and how we can control it with the help of JUnit5 annotations.</p>
<h5 id="getting-started">Getting started</h5>
<p>We will use the following <code class="language-java">User</code> class in our example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class User {
    private static final int MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 8;
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public boolean hasStrongPassword() {
        return password != null &amp;&amp; password.length() &gt;= MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH;
    }

    public boolean hasValidUsername() {
        return username != null &amp;&amp; !username.isBlank();
    }

    public boolean isValid() {
        return hasValidUsername() &amp;&amp; hasStrongPassword();
    }

    // getters and setters
}</code></pre>
<p>It has two private <code class="language-java">String</code> fields, <code class="language-java">username</code> and <code class="language-java">password</code>, a constructor that takes two <code class="language-java">String</code> arguments, and three public methods to check if an instance of the class <code class="language-java">User</code> has a valid username, a strong password, which is considered strong if it is at least 8 characters long, and represents a valid <code class="language-java">User</code>, which means that it has a valid username and a strong password.</p>
<p>Also, we have the following test suite to test the correctness of the implementation of the <code class="language-java">User</code> class methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class UserTest {

    @Test
    void hasStrongPassword() {
        String username = "Alice";
        String password = "12345678";
        User user = new User(username, password);

        assertTrue(user.hasStrongPassword());
    }

    @Test
    void hasValidUsername() {
        String username = "Alice";
        String password = "12345678";
        User user = new User(username, password);

        assertTrue(user.hasValidUsername());
    }

    @Test
    void isValid() {
        String username = "Alice";
        String password = "12345678";
        User user = new User(username, password);

        assertTrue(user.isValid());
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Look at the implementation of these tests. Each of them is completely independent of the others. We are not calling any test in another test and each test uses a new instance of the <code class="language-java">User</code> class. This may not make much sense in this particular case, but if we are testing more complex classes we will want to start each time with a clean state of the object being tested.</p>
<p>This means that we should not create a single instance of a class and share it among all tests, since a certain test may leave some state in the object that might affect the results of other tests. That is why we should execute each test using a new instance of the tested class.</p>
<p>However, in our case, we initialized a new object of the <code class="language-java">User</code> class in each test method repeating the same code in multiple places, which generally is a bad idea.</p>
<p>In our example, we wrote just a few tests and the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12867" target="_blank" title="In Java, initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable or an object. | This can be done in several ways, such as through a constructor, an instance initialization block, or a static initialization block. The Java compiler also allows for automatic type inference during initialization, where the type is determined based on the assigned value. Initialization is an important concept in Java because it ensures that objects are properly set up before they are used in a program.">initialization</a> requires only a few lines of code (we even could have done it as a one-liner), but in other projects, we could have classes that require more lines of code to initialize their instances. Also, notice that we tested just the happy path of execution of the <code class="language-java">User</code> class methods, but in a real project we will have to check every execution path of every method, and this will require us to write many tests. Fortunately, JUnit5 provides us tools using which we can better organize code according to our needs.</p>
<h5 id="test-class-instance-lifecycle">Test class instance lifecycle</h5>
<p>First, let's talk about how JUnit5 executes our tests. It creates a new instance of the test class before executing each test method. This way it ensures execution of individual test methods in isolation to avoid possible side effects produced by any changes of state of the test class instance.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p><code class="language-java">@TestInstance</code> annotation controls the test class instance lifecycle. It is set to <code class="language-java">TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_METHOD</code> by default but can be changed if necessary.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Also, JUnit5 has special annotations to designate any methods as <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-instance-lifecycle" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lifecycle</a> methods, such as <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code>, <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code>, <code class="language-java">@BeforeEach</code> or <code class="language-java">@AfterEach</code>, to instruct the framework to execute the designated methods before or after executing actual test methods.</p>
<p>The annotations <code class="language-java">@BeforeEach</code> and <code class="language-java">@AfterEach</code> indicate that the annotated method will be executed before and, respectively, after each method of the test class annotated with <code class="language-java">@Test</code>, while <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code> and <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code> methods will be executed before or after all the <code class="language-java">@Test</code> methods in the test class.</p>
<p>In the next example, we create a new test class to see how <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12867" target="_blank" title="In Java, a lifecycle annotation is a type of annotation used in JUnit testing framework to designate any method as a lifecycle method, indicating to the framework to execute the designated method before or after executing the actual test method. | The annotations @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, @Before, and @After are examples of lifecycle annotations. The methods annotated with @BeforeClass and @AfterClass are executed before or after all the methods in the test class, while the methods annotated with @Before and @After are executed before and after each method of the test class, respectively. This helps in better organizing the code, separating the test fixture initialization logic from the test case assertion, and controlling the state of the test class.">lifecycle annotations</a> actually work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

public class LifeCycleTest {

    LifeCycleTest() {
        System.out.println("Test Class Constructor");
    }

    @BeforeAll
    static void beforeAll() {
        System.out.println("Before the test fixture");
    }

    @AfterAll
    static void afterAll() {
        System.out.println("After the test fixture");
    }

    @BeforeEach
    void beforeEach() {
        System.out.println("Before each test");
    }

    @AfterEach
    void afterEach() {
        System.out.println("After each test");
    }

    @Test
    void test1() {
        System.out.println("Test 1");
    }

    @Test
    void test2() {
        System.out.println("Test 2");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>A test fixture is a fixed state of objects intended to provide a known and fixed environment for running tests.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Note that the methods annotated with <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code> and <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code> are static, because this way they can be shared among new test class instances created for each test method.</p>
<p>Running the tests gives the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Before the test fixture
Test Class Constructor
Before each test
Test 1
After each test
Test Class Constructor
Before each test
Test 2
After each test
After the test fixture</code></pre>
<p>The following diagram illustrates this order to help you better understand the test class lifecycle:</p>
<p><picture><img alt="test class lifecycle" height="972" src="https://ucarecdn.com/2e127439-b117-4112-a576-d61a5e649e93/" width="1474"/></picture></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, if your test class has ten test methods, the methods annotated with <code class="language-java">@BeforeEach</code> and <code class="language-java">@AfterEach</code> will execute ten times each, while the methods annotated with <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code> and <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code> will execute only once. Also, note that JUnit5 constructs a new instance of the test class before executing each test method.</p>
<h5 id="using-lifecycle-annotations">Using lifecycle annotations</h5>
<p>Now, we may rewrite our <code class="language-java">UserTest</code> class and get rid of initialization of <code class="language-java">User</code> instances in each test method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class UserTest {

    User user;

    @BeforeEach
    void createUser() {
        String username = "Alice";
        String password = "12345678";
        user = new User(username, password);
    }

    @Test
    void hasStrongPassword() {
        assertTrue(user.hasStrongPassword());
    }

    @Test
    void hasValidUsername() {
        assertTrue(user.hasValidUsername());
    }

    @Test
    void isValid() {
        assertTrue(user.isValid());
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>What are the other cases when lifecycle annotation may help? <code class="language-java">@BeforeEach</code> , as you have seen, may be used to set up new instances of the classes being tested. <code class="language-java">@AfterEach</code> is handy to clean up any side effects of the execution of the tests or to provide detailed information about their execution and results. <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code> and <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code> are great for setting up and tearing down the entire test fixture. You may use methods annotated by <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code> to create and initialize big data structures, establish connections to data sources, fetch data from databases, remote repositories, or hard drives, and after that close resources and clean everything up in <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code> methods.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, we can write the following implementation of our test class with a pre-defined set of input data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class UserTest {

    static String[] names;
    static String[] passwords;
    static boolean[] expectedOutcomes;

    static int index = 0;

    User user;
    boolean expected;

    @BeforeAll
    static void setUp() {
        names = new String[] {"Alice", "Alice", "Alice", "", null, "    "};
        passwords = new String[] {"12345678", "123", null, "12345678", "12345678", "12345678"};
        expectedOutcomes = new boolean[] {true, false, false, false, false, false};
    }

    @BeforeEach
    void createUser() {
        user = new User(names[index], passwords[index]);
        expected = expectedOutcomes[index];
    }

    @AfterEach
    void incrementIndex() {
        index++;
    }

    @RepeatedTest(value = 6, name = "user.isValid() test {currentRepetition}/{totalRepetitions}")
    void isValid() {
        assertEquals(expected, user.isValid());
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we used <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-repeated-tests" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">@RepeatedTest</a> to run the annotated test 6 times (<code class="language-java">value = 6</code>) and defined a custom name for displaying test results. <code class="language-java">{currentRepetition}</code> and <code class="language-java">{totalRepetitions}</code> are placeholders for displaying the current run and the total number of test runs. Here is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">UserTest &gt; user.isValid() test 1/6 PASSED
UserTest &gt; user.isValid() test 2/6 PASSED
UserTest &gt; user.isValid() test 3/6 PASSED
UserTest &gt; user.isValid() test 4/6 PASSED
UserTest &gt; user.isValid() test 5/6 PASSED
UserTest &gt; user.isValid() test 6/6 PASSED</code></pre>
<p>Even in this simple example lifecycle annotations help us create multiple test cases with ease.</p>
<h5 id="test-instance-per-class">Test instance per class</h5>
<p>If for any reason you would like to execute all test methods on the same instance of the test class, JUnit5 allows you to do so by annotating the test class with <code class="language-java">@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)</code>. In this mode, a new instance of the test class will be created only once, therefore if your test methods rely on a state stored in its non-static variables, you may need to reset that state in <code class="language-java">@BeforeEach</code> or <code class="language-java">@AfterEach</code> methods.</p>
<p>We will see how <code class="language-java">PER_CLASS</code> works in another example. First, let's add this annotation to our <code class="language-java">LifeCycleTest</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
public class LifeCycleTest {

    LifeCycleTest() {
        System.out.println("Test Class Constructor");
    }

    @BeforeAll
    static void beforeAll() {
        System.out.println("Before the test fixture");
    }

    @AfterAll
    static void afterAll() {
        System.out.println("After the test fixture");
    }

    @BeforeEach
    void beforeEach() {
        System.out.println("Before each test");
    }

    @AfterEach
    void afterEach() {
        System.out.println("After each test");
    }

    @Test
    void test1() {
        System.out.println("Test 1");
    }

    @Test
    void test2() {
        System.out.println("Test 2");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that since the test class instance is shared among all test methods, there is no need for the <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code> and <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code> methods to be static. Now let's run it and see what has changed compared to the new instance per test method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Test Class Constructor
Before the test fixture
Before each test
Test 1
After each test
Before each test
Test 2
After each test
After the test fixture</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>For the per test method test instance lifecycle, remove the <code class="language-java">@TestInstance</code> annotation from your test class or explicitly use <code class="language-java">@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_METHOD)</code>.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the method call sequence:</p>
<p><picture><img alt="method call sequence" height="1088" src="https://ucarecdn.com/392e5aad-bafe-4341-8095-d947b810514c/" width="1474"/></picture></p>
<p>If you are using this mode and your test methods rely on state stored in instance variables, you may need to reset that state in <code class="language-java">@BeforeEach</code> or <code class="language-java">@AfterEach</code> methods to avoid unexpected side effects.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>When we write test methods we do the following: set up, initialize and assert. If we have many test methods we have to repeat these lines of code multiple times. We can use lifecycle method annotations <code class="language-java">@BeforeAll</code>, <code class="language-java">@AfterAll</code>, <code class="language-java">@BeforeEach</code>, and <code class="language-java">@AfterEach</code> to better organize code, separate text fixture initialization logic from test case assertions, and control the state of our test class. JUnit uses a new test instance per each test method by default. In the case we need a single test instance for our test class, we can use <code class="language-java">@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)</code> annotation.</p>
