<h5 id="the-callable-interface">The Callable interface</h5><p>Sometimes you need not only to execute a task in an executor but also to return a result of this task to the calling code. It is possible but an inconvenient thing to do with <code class="language-java">Runnable</code>'s.</p><p>In order to simplify it, an executor supports another class of tasks named <code class="language-java">Callable</code> that returns the result and may throw an exception.

Once declared, a type parameter can be used within the class or method body as an ordinary type. The advantage of using type parameters is that they enable you to write more abstract code and develop reusable software libraries. At the time of creating an object of the class or invoking the method, a concrete type is determined for the type parameter.">type parameter</a> <code class="language-java">V</code> determines the type of a result. Since it is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4905" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a functional interface is a special kind of interface that contains a single abstract method, although it can also contain default, static, and non-abstract methods. | A functional interface can be implemented and instantiated using a lambda expression or a method reference. The Java compiler automatically creates a special hidden class for lambda expressions and method references. The annotation can be used to force checking whether an interface satisfies the requirement of the functional interface. The concept of functional interfaces is an essential part of functional programming in Java, which is built on top of object-oriented programming (OOP), especially interfaces and polymorphism."><strong>functional interface</strong></a>, we can use it together with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4905" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a lambda expression is a function that is not bound to a name (an anonymous function) and can be assigned to a variable. | It consists of a list of parameters followed by the body that can return a value. Lambda expressions are often used to pass a block of code as data to a method. They allow for more readable and concise code, and can be used in place of method references. Lambda expressions have a special type, and there are several types of lambda expressions defined in the Java standard library, such as Function and Predicate, both located in the java.util.function package.">lambda expressions</a> and <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4905" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a method reference is a way to refer to a specific method by its name, which can be invoked at any time it is needed. | It is a more readable and easier to test alternative to lambda expressions. Method references can refer to both standard and custom methods. There are four kinds of method references: reference to a static method, reference to an instance method of an existing object, reference to an instance method of an object of a particular type, and reference to a constructor. For example, a reference to a static method can be created using the following general form: `ContainingClass::staticMethodName`.">method references</a> as well as implementing classes.</p><p>Here is a <code class="language-java">Callable</code> that emulates a long-running task and returns a number that was "calculated".</p><pre><code class="language-java">Callable&lt;Integer&gt; generator = () -&gt; {
