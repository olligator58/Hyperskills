<div class="step-text">
<p>Consider the following snippet of Java code:</p><pre><code class="java">
try {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
    List&lt;Callable&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; callables = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    // Assume Exception throwing Tasks are added to the callables
    // ___(1)___
} catch(InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception occurred!");
}
</code></pre><p>Fill the blank (represented as ___(1)___), to execute all the callables - implicitly handling exceptions in the callables - and to retrieve the results when all tasks have finished execution. Select the statements that best fit the blank.</p>
